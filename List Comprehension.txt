List Comprehension

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside
list comprehension helps us to do loops in one line of code.

Exapmle:
colours = ["blue","black","pink","purple","orange"]
newlist=[x for x in colours if "l" in x]
print(newlist)
